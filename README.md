Affaan's Data Science Projects Completed as part of MIT Professional Education's Bootcamp

The Applied Data Science Program is developed for professionals who want to understand how to make data-driven business decisions. This 12-week program enables learners to upgrade their data analytics skills, learning the theory and practical application of supervised and unsupervised learning, time-series analysis, recommendation systems, regression, and more. Upon successful fulfillment of requirements, learners receive a [Certificate of Completion](sandbox:/mnt/data/Certificate_Of_Completion.pdf) from MIT Professional Education. The program is delivered in collaboration with Great Learning, leveraging MIT's leadership in innovation, science, engineering, and technical disciplines. The aim is to build industry-valued skills and prepare learners to participate in or lead data science efforts at any organization.
