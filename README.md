Affaan's Data Science Projects Completed as part of MIT Professional Educations Bootcamp
The Applied Data Science Program is developed for any professional who wants to understand how to make data-driven business decisions. In this program that lasts for 12 weeks, learners will be able to upgrade their data analytics skills by learning the theory and practical application of supervised and unsupervised learning, time-series analysis, recommendation systems, and regression, to name a few. Upon successful fulfillment of requirements, learners will receive a Certificate of Completion from MIT Professional Education at the end of the program.

This program from MIT Professional Education is delivered in collaboration with Great Learning. It leverages MIT's leadership in innovation, science, engineering, and technical disciplines developed over years of research, teaching, and practice. The program aims to build industry-valued skills and to prepare learners to participate in or lead data science efforts at any organization.The Applied Data Science Program is developed for any professional who wants to understand how to make data-driven business decisions.

Analysis of diabetes in populations of pima Indian individuals, in which I applied machine learning techniques
and statistical techniques such as OLS regression, bootstrapping, Linear Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression,
Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Time Series, and other methods.

Working on a Case Study and Research Paper to test the question: "To what extent do Twitter sentiment and Reddit discussions influence price fluctuations in microcap cryptocurrencies with a
market cap under $1 million in the past 6 months, and how do these factors interact with each other?"
